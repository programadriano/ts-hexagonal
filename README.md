# Hexagonal Architecture

## Project
This project was developed to demonstrate how to create a clean architecture using the principles of hexagonal architecture, as presented by Alistair Cockburn.


## Desenvolvimento

To run the project, first, you need to import the packages using the command npm i. With the packages imported, just execute the command npm run compile to transpile the project and the command npm start to run the API.

The project has three endpoints, one POST for creating a new user, a GET to return the list of created users, and a health check route for validation.
